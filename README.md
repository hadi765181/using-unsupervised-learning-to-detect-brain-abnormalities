# using-unsupervised-learning-to-detect-brain-abnormalities
Unsupervised learning can be effectively applied to model normal brain activity by training on large datasets of healthy brain scans without the need for labeled anomalies. This approach enables the model to learn the inherent patterns, structures, and statistical distributions that characterize typical brain function. Once trained, the model establishes a baseline representation of normalcy, allowing it to act as a reference for comparison when analyzing new data.
When presented with brain scans that deviate from this learned norm—such as those exhibiting signs of neurological disorders, lesions, or other abnormalities—the model can detect these irregularities as outliers. Techniques such as autoencoders, variational autoencoders, or clustering algorithms like k-means or can be employed to flag deviations. In more advanced implementations, anomaly scores can be generated to quantify the degree of deviation from normal patterns.
