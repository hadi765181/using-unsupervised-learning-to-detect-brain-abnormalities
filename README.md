# using-unsupervised-learning-to-detect-brain-abnormalities
Unsupervised learning models normal brain activity by training on healthy scans, identifying typical patterns. When given abnormal scans, it detects deviations as anomalies, enabling early detection of neurological issues without needing labeled data.
